# DREAM Big Data Challenge
R scripts for the DREAM big data predictive modelling competition: [AML Outcome Predition Challenge](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn2455683/wiki/) 
- There are three sub-challenges and the write-up for sub-challeneg 1 can be found out in my [blog](http://hongleixie.github.io/blog/AML-Q1).
- Our team, ***Chipmunks***, were ranked the 1st place in sub-challeneg 2&3. Our model in sub-challenge 1 once ranked top 5 in leaderboard.
- Winning models manuscript, *A Crowd Sourcing Approach to Developing and Assessing Prediction Algorithms for AML Prognosis*, has been published in *PLOS Computational Biology*. Paper [link](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004890)
